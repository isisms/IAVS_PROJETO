Regional Revolving Funds
Regional Revolving Funds


The PAHO Regional Revolving Funds (RRF) are technical cooperation mechanisms that enable countries in the Americas to access quality vaccines, essential medicines, and public health supplies at affordable prices in a timely and transparent manner.
Since their inception, the Regional Revolving Funds have helped to improve access to essential health supplies in countries across the Americas. They have played a key role in the fight against diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. They have also helped to improve immunization coverage and reduce maternal and child mortality, as well as contributed to the eradication of diseases among polio and others.
The PAHO Regional Revolving Funds are an essential tool for improving health and well-being in the Americas. They help countries to ensure that everyone has access to the health supplies they need.
